What was originally planned for your final project: I planned to make ChatApp that will be totally GUI Based. Both Client and server messages will be shown on the chat window. 
What was delivered in your Final Project: A ChatApp that connects a client and server, shows messages from client on a window, shows connection success message and closes the connections when the window is closed. 

What would be the next feature(s) you would add if you had more time: Make this app GUI based so that server and client messages are shown on the window and not just clients message. Also make a GUI for server.
